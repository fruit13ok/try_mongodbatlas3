// How to exclude fields sending from database to the server, such as user password, collection _id, and data update version _v?

1) NOTE
Exclude unnecessary field have 2 benefits.
-Package send from database won't carry excluded data. People fetch the data, won't see it.
-Smaller package send over internet, improve performance.


2) Some field cannot exclude.
-When create / save new data, the auto send back object cannot be exclude. Now just use the sent back object for debug.
-For relational data that need to store and lookup reference field such as "id" to fetch related data, "id" field cannot be exclude, "id" looks like "_id", but it is a reference. Same for virtual populate which use user "_id"


3) (server request in index.js) How to exclude fields when requesting from database?
-For normal collection without reference. Such as "user"
after ".find()" use ".select('-fields separate with space')" fields must belong to this collection
EX:
let foundUser = await User.find({username: userName})
.select('-__v -userpassword');  // exclude version number and password

-For related collection that reference other collection. Such as "resultbacklink"
after ".find()" and ".select()" inside ".populate()" add '-fields separate with space' fields must belong to this collection
EX:
let allResultbacklink = await Resultbacklink.find()
.select('-_id -__v -backlinks._id')
.populate('user', '-_id -__v -userpassword')
.exec();

    // fields to exclude from resultbacklink
    .select('-_id -__v -backlinks._id')
    // 'user' is ResultbacklinkSchema's field name, fields to exclude from user
    // note: populate reference user id using "id", so do not exclude "id"
    .populate('user', '-_id -__v -userpassword')

-For virtual related collection that being referenced by other collection. Such as "user"
after ".find()", ".select()" fields to exclude from user, ".populate()" fields to exclude from virtual related collection
EX:
let foundUser = await User.find({username: userName})
.select('-__v -userpassword')
.populate('virtualResultbacklink', '-__v -_id -backlinks._id')
.populate('virtualResultrelatedsearch', '-__v -_id -relatedsearchs._id')
.exec();

    // fields to exclude from user, need to include user '_id' for virtual populate
    .select('-__v -userpassword')
 

4) (Schema setting in user.js) How to exclude fields inside schema? This way, request must explicitly include the field inorder to get it.
// when writing schema, use "select" option set to "false" to not allow query, request can still force include with .select('+userpassword')
EX:
userpassword: { 
    type: String, 
    trim: true,
    required: [true, 'User must have a password'],
    select: false
},
